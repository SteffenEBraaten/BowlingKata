# Bowling
________

The bowling kata implemented in Kotlin.
Link to the original kata description can be found here: http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/

Albert Llousas Ortiz(albertllousas) implementation of the kata has been used
as inspiration for the implementation for this kata as it's structure and design
was appealing. However I figured I could make the implementation of the kata more
readable by adding companion objects and redesign how to final score was calculated.
This has resulted that the focus of this kata has been on the readability of the code
and not optimization.
